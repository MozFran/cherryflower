    <h3>Briefing</h3>
    <p>Kiaslaño was first discovered and inhabited by the Spanish in the 1610's, mainly being used as a shipping point. In 1810, when Mexico successfully declared their independence from Spain, Kiaslaño attempted the same, but were annexed by Mexico and given autonomy, as the Autonomous Mexican Kiaslaño. In 1920, toward the end of the Mexican Revolution, Kiaslaño ceeded from Mexico and declared their independence, as the Principality of Kiaslaño, ruled over by Crown Prince Carlos I. They briefly assisted the US and Canada during World War II, after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour. In 1949, Carlos II abolishes the Principality, founding the Federal Republic of Kiaslaño, ruling in the background as a symbolic monarch. In 1957, a Uranium deposit is discovered in Martin County, and in 1960, Kiaslaño developed their first, and only, nuclear bomb, named the TnK-1. It was never used and was decommissioned in 1965, well before the SALT I negotiations. In 1971, the country collapsed into Civil War, after Prime Minister, and Monarchist sympathiser Carlos Xavier, calls for a public uprising against the Presidency and the Republic. The war would rage on for 5 years before US and NATO involvement quickly tipped the scales. In 1979, the war had mostly fizzled out. On November 5  1980, Francisco Valentino is elected the President of the Second Kiaslano Republic.</p>
